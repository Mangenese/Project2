# Critcal Hit
A yelp style based video game review website for when you want to review your favorite games!

## Features 
Home page will have a search bar for users to search for specific video games.

What this means is that it will pull from the API Rawg and display a description of the game that you search for.

When you click on the blue hyperlink it will take you to a review tab where you can create a game specific review.

Users will be allowed to create reviews as well as see what other users have wrote as well.
